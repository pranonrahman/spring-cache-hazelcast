          # Configuration has the following attributes:
          # - size: Maximum size of the map.
          # - max-size-policy: Maximum size policy for eviction of the map. Available values are as follows:
          #   * PER_NODE:
          #     Maximum number of map entries in each cluster member. You cannot set the max-size to a value lower
          #     than the partition count (which is 271 by default).
          #   * PER_PARTITION:
          #     Maximum number of map entries within each partition.
          #   * USED_HEAP_SIZE:
          #     Maximum used heap size in megabytes per map for each Hazelcast instance. It does not work when
          #     "in-memory-format" is set to OBJECT.
          #   * USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE:
          #     Maximum used heap size percentage per map for each Hazelcast instance. If, for example, JVM is
          #     configured to have 1000 MB and this value is 10, then the map entries will be evicted when used heap size
          #     exceeds 100 MB. It does not work when "in-memory-format" is set to OBJECT.
          #   * FREE_HEAP_SIZE:
          #     Minimum free heap size in megabytes for each Hazelcast instance.
          #   * FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE:
          #     Minimum free heap size percentage for each Hazelcast instance. If, for example, JVM is configured to
          #     have 1000 MB and this value is 10, then the map entries will be evicted when free heap size is below 100 MB.
          #   * USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE:
          #     Maximum used native memory size in megabytes per map for each Hazelcast instance. It is available only in
          #     Hazelcast Enterprise HD.
          #   * USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE:
          #     Maximum used native memory size percentage per map for each Hazelcast instance. It is available only in
          #     Hazelcast Enterprise HD.
          #   * FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE:
          #     Minimum free native memory size in megabytes for each Hazelcast instance. It is available only in
          #     Hazelcast Enterprise HD.
          #   * FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE:
          #     Minimum free native memory size percentage for each Hazelcast instance. It is available only in
          #     Hazelcast Enterprise HD.
